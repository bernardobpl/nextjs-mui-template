## This is my public NextJS SASS Template
This template was created using ```yarn create next-app {name} --typescript```
I decided to create this template to get an project initial setup faster.
Don't feel afraid to open a bright white screen, i took care of it ðŸ‘Œ.


Using my template will save your time with those:
* Typescript
* Eslint
* Prettier
* Husky
* Lint-staged
* Next Document
* Creating "src" folder
* Cleaning NextJS template
* Material UI setup
* Emotion setup
